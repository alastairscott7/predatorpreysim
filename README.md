# predatorpreysim
predator prey simulation assignment

This was a project for an object oriented programming course at SFU called ENSC 251.
The purpose was to create a grid of spaces where ants (prey) and doodlebugs (prey) will spawn.
The doodlebugs will eat the ants if they find one, and will starve if they don't after 3 moves.
Both organisms can breed and create an additional organism of their type.
